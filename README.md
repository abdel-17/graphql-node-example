# GraphQL Yoga Server
An example GraphQL server built with the GraphQL Yoga library.

## Setup
To initialize the SQLite database, run the following command:
```sh
pnpm db:init
```

This will create a /database directory with a database.db file and run the migration files.

Then, start the server with the following command:
```sh
pnpm start
```
